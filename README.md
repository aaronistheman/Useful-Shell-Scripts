# Useful-Shell-Scripts

This repository contains multiple shell scripts that I've found worth
using in multiple projects. At least some of them involve Git and thus
should be run from a Git console, such as Git Bash. Each shell script
contains a description regarding how to use it.

Some of the scripts contain a description about how to use them.
At least some of them were made to be run from a Git console,
such as Git Bash. For example, one could type the following in Git Bash:

```script
  $ add-file.sh hello-world.txt
```
